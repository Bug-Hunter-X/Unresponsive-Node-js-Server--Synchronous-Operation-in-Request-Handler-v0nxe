This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers: unresponsiveness caused by a long-running synchronous operation within the request handler.  The `bug.js` file contains code that simulates this problem by introducing a 5-second delay.  This blocks the event loop, preventing the server from responding to subsequent requests. The solution in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to avoid this by using asynchronous operations.
